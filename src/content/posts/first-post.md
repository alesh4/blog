There are days days when we are busy, so busy that we can't keep up, but there are days that seem so clam, calm like a lake in the middle of cold winter - you know, of those days when no one visits the lake. Not even the ducks. Today feels like one of those days calm days when we can reflect back on life. As I reflect on the oddies life brings, I'm reminded on that one day that led to my re-employment. I guess it's time for some ramble. 

Job hunting feels like a never ending cycle, scroll through job boards, update resume, submit your application. After a week—or sometimes a year—you find the rejection in the email inbox. The most disappointment is when you craft the resume, the cover letter, all for a job you think you will be a perfect fit, and only to find that rejection email not long after that. 

At this point in time, I had applied to several jobs, some that I felt qualified for, and some that the AI wrote  how qualified I'm for the job. I recevied a call for an interview at another State. Relocation was no problem for me, I had been hoping for an opportunity to move. I scheduled said interview. Told them I'll be there. Due to some personal circumstances, I had to drive there instead of flying; additionally, flying is more costly, specially when funds are limited. 

Anyway, so I drove for 16 hours to another State for an intervier I had just a couple of days later. So, there I am at a hotel in the middle of some town sipping on some coffee. Then, the phone rigs, and the person on the other line is the talent acuquisition person for another—much better opporunity—wanting to know what date I can start. 

That month felt like some rollercoaster. Going from job hunting with no end on sight, to a phone call just as I was was getting ready to move to another State. 

And so, I plan to use this blog to write some stories about the baddly code I write as I learn to improve my coding knowledge.
